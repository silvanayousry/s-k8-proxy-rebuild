### Changed

- Added content management switch to control image stream blanking in PDF export:-  
  A change made in previous versions to blank out image streams in pdf export was causing issues for some customers so this is now controllable. A new content management switch <retain_exported_stream>has been added to the options for PDF. When set to sanitise it will cause the image stream to be blanked out. For other values or if not provided, and then image streams will not be blanked out, i.e. as previous behaviour.
